      <h2>Why Cross-Functional?</h2>
      <p>
        Most product content focuses on a single discipline. We take a different approach by
        exploring how product managers, designers, and engineers can work together more
        effectively. Every article includes perspectives from multiple disciplines and actionable
        takeaways for each role.
      </p>

      <h2>Who We're For</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you're a product manager trying to understand design trade-offs, a designer
        learning about technical constraints, or an engineer exploring product strategy,
        ProductBuilders.tech helps you develop a shared vocabulary and mutual understanding with your
        cross-functional partners.
