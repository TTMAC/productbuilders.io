<!-- TODO: Phase 2 - Complete book review -->

**Note: This is a Phase 2 stub. Full review coming soon.**

*Inspired* by Marty Cagan is widely considered the definitive guide to modern product management. This review will explore why this book matters for cross-functional product teams and how its principles apply across PM, Design, and Engineering.

## What This Book Covers

The book is divided into four major parts:

1. **People** - Building strong product teams
2. **Process** - Product discovery and delivery
3. **Product** - What makes products successful
4. **Company** - Scaling product organizations

## Why Cross-Functional Teams Should Read This

### For Product Managers

This is essential reading for understanding the difference between output and outcomes, and how to lead empowered teams.

### For Designers

Cagan emphasizes continuous discovery with customers - a practice that benefits from strong design involvement. Understanding this framework helps designers advocate for proper research and validation.

### For Engineers

The book explains why product managers ask for certain things and how engineering can influence product decisions through technical insight. It promotes a model where engineers are problem-solvers, not just implementers.

## Key Concepts (Phase 2 will expand these)

- **Empowered Teams**: Why autonomy with accountability beats feature factories
- **Product Discovery**: How to validate ideas before building
- **Product/Market Fit**: What it really means and how to achieve it
- **Missionary vs. Mercenary**: Building teams that care about outcomes
